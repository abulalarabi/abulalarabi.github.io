      <span>Graduate Assistant-Research &bull; Sep 2021 - Current</span>
       <ol class="timeline-list">
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Action Planning of a Laboratory Gantry Robot using Large Language Model [WIP]: The goal of this work is to enable natural language-based task planning for laboratory gantry robots. We developed a large language model–driven framework that interprets high-level user instructions, decomposes them into task-level actions, and generates corresponding low-level control parameters for a 5-DOF gantry robot.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Fabrication of Humanoid Robot and Learning from Demonstration for Human-Robot Interaction: In this study, our primary focus was on developing FABRIC, an end-to-end, learning-from-demonstration (LfD) toolkit enabling low-cost fabrication and kinematic programming of bodily-expressive robots. The system integrates pose estimation with a fully 3D-printable, 22-DOF robotic platform and a visual programming interface, facilitating user-authored sign language synthesis and customizable embodied interactions for accessible human-robot communication. This work is open-sourced here.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Emotions Amplified- Impact of Head Movement in Sign Language Avatar: This work investigates the generation and impact of head movement in sign language avatar. We developed an AI-driven system that generates emotionally expressive head gestures for signing avatars using a hybrid Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework. The model learns natural kinematics from sign language data and applies a parametric emotion model to convey seven core affective states. We are conducting a user study with Deaf participants to investigate perceived emotional expressivity, presence, and naturalness.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Large Language Model for End-User Reconfiguration of Environment: The goal of this research is to enable end-users to augment everyday objects using 3D printed attachments. We developed an agentic AI framework for end-user generative fabrication that interprets vague multimodal inputs to identify latent interaction challenges and propose explainable, fabrication-ready augmentations. Leveraging multimodal large language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and in-context learning, the system retrieves design knowledge from research literature and repositories, converts non-parametric models into parametric ones, and exposes interpretable parameters for user customization. We introduced a quantitative CLEAR metric to evaluate input ambiguity.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Underground Metal Pipe Detection and Haptic Feedback for Construction Works: Underground metal pipes pose major challenges during excavation. We built a wireless sensor network using IMU and magnetometer sensors, where a bucket-mounted node detects magnetic fields from buried pipes and a reference sensor compensates for excavator-induced offsets. Using multivariate linear regression, we estimated pipe distance from the excavator tip and mapped it to haptic feedback intensity. Two modalities—vibrotactile and electrotactile—were integrated, with user studies showing electrotactile feedback more effective in noisy construction environments.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Ubiquitous Microvibration Harvesters for Context-Aware Sensing: Millions of sensing devices rely on batteries, creating sustainability and accessibility challenges for ubiquitous sensing. We developed low-cost, 3D-printed microvibration harvesters that capture ambient mechanical energy for self-powered, context-aware sensing. We built a parametric design framework and vision-language model–guided editor to help non-experts identify vibration sources and fabricate harvesters using FDM printing. We optimized electromagnetic designs to harvest energy across diverse frequencies, powering batteryless sensing tasks such as activity recognition, appliance monitoring, and environmental tracking.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">RLScara: Reinforcement Learning-Based Control of a SCARA Manipulator: This work aims to develop a digital twin of a SCARA-style manipulator and train it using reinforcement learning for autonomous motion control. We built a virtual and physical SCARA platform and applied Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to learn inverse kinematics, mapping target positions to joint commands. We designed a modular, cascaded-link SCARA robot with parametrically configurable links and validated the trained policy across both the simulation environment and a 3D-printed, Arduino-based prototype. This project is open-sourced here.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Interaction Energy Harvesting: This work aims at addressing the sustainability and maintenance challenges of battery-powered IoT devices. We developed an end-to-end toolkit that enables non-experts to design and fabricate 3D-printed mechanisms for harvesting energy from everyday kinetic interactions. We used smartwatch-based motion capture and machine learning to classify activities, then generated parametric designs that convert these motions into electricity using DC generators. We demonstrated multiple real-world applications, showing sufficient power to sustain common IoT sensors and smart devices.</p></li>
        <li class="timeline-item"><p class="timeline-text">Robotizing Everyday Objects: The goal of this work is to robotize everyday objects with mobility and enable end-users to automate routine tasks through personal fabrication. We developed an end-to-end toolkit that captures design and motion requirements from real-world demonstrations and automatically generates 3D-printable attachments, electronics specifications, and control programs. We used smartphone-based sensing to first obtain geometry information using object detection, and second, estimate trajectories with built-in IMU sensors. This information is used to estimate mechanism parameters and motion plans, supporting translation, rotation, and lifting motions for diverse everyday applications.</p></li>

I led the team and design &amp; fabrication of three Mars rover prototypes equipped with a 6-DOF robotic arm supporting inverse kinematics for manipulator automation, a lambda suspension system for rough terrain, off-grid autonomous traversal, long-range communication, and integrated on-board/off-board imaging, sensing, and perception capabilities. Under my leadership, our team participated in and ranked among the top teams in the University Rover Challenge organized by the Mars Society at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), Utah, USA.
