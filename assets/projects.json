    "project-name": "FABRIC: 22 DOF Bodily-Expressive Robots",
    "descriptions": "Sign language is a vital visual-manual communication method for individuals with hearing impairments, yet current robotic systems remain expensive and technically inaccessible for embodied interaction. We present FABRIC, a low-cost, end-to-end toolkit that enables users to 3D print expressive robots and program bodily language through learning-from-demonstration. FABRIC supports upper-torso motion replication using video input and offers an intuitive visual programming interface, lowering barriers to designing embodied, communicative robots for diverse applications.",

    "project-name": "Mars Rover",
    "descriptions": "The Mars Rover project aims to develop a fully autonomous robotic system capable of navigating the Martian terrain, conducting scientific experiments, and transmitting data back to Earth. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms and robust engineering, the rover will be equipped with a suite of instruments to analyze soil samples, search for signs of past life, and capture high-resolution images of the Martian landscape.",
